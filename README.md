Human Ageing Epigenetics Using Oxford Nanopore Long Reads DNA RRMS Sequencing
This script uses DNA methylation .bed files obtained with Oxford Nanopore human DNA sequencing to find the CpGs methylated in direct or reversed correlattion with ageing.  
Due to limitations on file size, our data can not be uploaded on github. It is available here instead as complete content of R working directory: http://gofile.me/76Mv5/imaOtyFz3
